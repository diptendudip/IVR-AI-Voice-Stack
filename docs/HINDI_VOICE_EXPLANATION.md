# Understanding Hindi Voice IVR in the Twilio System

## How Hindi Voice IVR Works

In your Twilio phone IVR system, there are several components working together:

1. **Twilio Phone Number**: The entry point for calls (947) 837-0966
2. **Twilio TwiML Interpreter**: Executes XML instructions for the call
3. **Azure Function**: Generates the TwiML instructions when called by Twilio
4. **Twilio Text-to-Speech (TTS) Engine**: Converts text to speech for callers

## Who Handles the Hindi Voice?

**Twilio** handles the text-to-speech conversion, not Azure. When your Azure Function returns TwiML like this:

```xml
<Say language="hi-IN">नमस्ते</Say>
```

Twilio's TTS engine processes this instruction and speaks the text in Hindi.

## Why Your Call Is Disconnecting

If calls are disconnecting after the English greeting but before the Hindi portion, there are several possible issues:

### 1. Voice Support Issues
Twilio may not fully support the Hindi language in your current configuration. Twilio offers several TTS providers:

- **Default Twilio**: Limited language support
- **Google**: More comprehensive language support (including Hindi)
- **Amazon Polly**: Good Hindi support with specific voices like "Aditi"

### 2. TwiML Structure Issues
Your TwiML might have structural issues that cause Twilio to stop processing:
- Long Hindi phrases might be harder to process
- Quick transitions between languages can cause issues
- Special characters or encoding problems

### 3. Twilio Plan Limitations
Your Twilio account plan might have limitations on:
- Call duration
- Language support
- TTS usage

## Solutions We've Implemented

We've created three different TwiML approaches to solve the issue:

### 1. Original Fix (TwilioFix)
Using voice="Polly.Aditi" for better Hindi pronunciation.

### 2. Segmented Hindi (TwilioFix3)
Breaking Hindi into smaller phrases with pauses between them:
```xml
<Say language="hi-IN">namaste</Say>
<Pause length="1"/>
<Say language="hi-IN">C G Net Swara mein aapka swagat hai.</Say>
```

### 3. Hinglish Approach (TwilioSimple)
Using Hindi words transliterated in English letters, which doesn't require language switching:
```xml
<Say>C G Net Swara mein aapka swagat hai.</Say>
```

## Testing & Deploying

All three implementations have been deployed and can be accessed at:

1. `/api/twilio-fix` - Original approach with Polly.Aditi voice
2. `/api/twilio-fix3` - Segmented Hindi with pauses
3. `/api/twilio-simple` - Hinglish approach (most reliable)

To test each implementation:
```bash
curl -X POST https://cgnet-ivr-func.azurewebsites.net/api/twilio-fix
curl -X POST https://cgnet-ivr-func.azurewebsites.net/api/twilio-fix3
curl -X POST https://cgnet-ivr-func.azurewebsites.net/api/twilio-simple
```

Then update your Twilio webhook URL to use whichever endpoint works best with your phone number.

## Additional Twilio Settings That May Help

If the above solutions don't fix the issue, try these Twilio account settings:

1. **Upgrade to Programmable Voice Geographic Permissions**: Add India as a permitted country
2. **Enable Polly Voice**: Make sure Amazon Polly is enabled for your account
3. **Check Rate Limiting**: Make sure your account isn't hitting rate limits

## Testing Your TwiML

You can also test your TwiML directly in Twilio's TwiML Bin:
1. Go to https://www.twilio.com/console/twiml-bins
2. Create a new TwiML Bin with your content
3. Point your phone number to that TwiML Bin temporarily
